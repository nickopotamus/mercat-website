We are MERCAT (Midlands East Research by Critical Care and Anaesthetic Trainees), the Trainee Research Network (TRN) for the East Midlands region. We help coordinate and run local, region, and national projects in anaesthesia and intensive care.

As a member of [RAFT](https://www.raftrainees.org/) ([Research & Audit Federation of Trainees](https://www.raftrainees.org/)) we are able to link to all the other TRNs nationally to run national projects in hospitals across the East Midlands.
