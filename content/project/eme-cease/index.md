The first MERCAT-lead obstetric anaesthetic project asked whether anti-emetic prophylaxis reduced the incidence of ergometrine-induced N&V during elective caesarean section under regional anaesthesia?

Aim:
* To evaluate the  current practice in the management  of ergometrine-induced nausea and vomiting across EMSA
* First MERCAT lead obstetric project
* Service evaluation across East Midlands School of Anaesthesia
* Nine hospital participating
* Ten trainees participated in recruitment and data collection

The results were presented regionally at the EMSA winter scientific meeting and MERCAT research day, and at the Annual OAA congress in Newcastle.
