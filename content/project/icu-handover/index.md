The first region-wide MERCAT lead project assessed intensive care handover, the bain of many a trainee's existence.

*Why Handover?*

Handover is a focal point of transfer of information on any intensive care. It is a key area for continuity of care. A handover QI project is applicable to all intensive care units from specialist to generalist (although the needs of each unit at handover will vary). Although nursing handover has received much attention, physician handover on ICU has been relatively neglected.

This first project is also being used as a test of the system, so we have deliberately chosen a fairly straightforward topic that should have easy data collection.

*What did the project entail?*

One week of data collection at each handover (morning and evening) during a week in March, including the weekend.

The data was then processed centrally, and each unit’s results returned back to it, as well as the amalgamated results being presented as a whole.

A “Handover working group” then analysed the data and recommended what we think the factors are that make the best ICU handover. This was circulated to all the ICUs in the region.

Results were presented at the MERCAT research day, and ICS State of the Art conference.
